    <p class="mx-8 my-5 p-2">"Chengyu (traditional Chinese: <span lang="zh-Hant-hk">成語</span> simplified Chinese: <span lang="zh-Hans">成语</span> pinyin: chéngyǔ lit. '[already] made/formed words/speech') are a type of traditional Chinese idiomatic expression, most of which consist of four characters. Chengyu were widely used in Classical Chinese and are still common in vernacular Chinese writing and in the spoken language today ... Chéngyǔ are considered the collected wisdom of the Chinese culture, and contain the experiences, moral concepts, and admonishments from previous generations of Chinese" <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chengyu">(Wikipedia)</a></p>

    <p class="mx-8 my-5 p-2">English speakers may recognize famous Chengyu that have made their way into English, such as <span>CTHD</span> (lit. 'Crouching tiger hidden dragon') or <span>BNMG</span> (lit. 'Long time no see').</p>

    <p class="mx-8 my-5 p-2">Chengyu are an essential part of Chinese conversation and cultural knowledge, and this website exists to preserve a slice of Cantonese cultural Chengyu, as well as offering an educational resource for those interested in learning about Chengyu and Chinese culture.</p>
