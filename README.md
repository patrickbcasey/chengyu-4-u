<h1 align="center">Chengyu 4 U</h1>
Chengyu 4 U is a website and API dedicated to Chinese idiomatic expressions. Users can see a variety of traditional chengyu, and learn their meanings and pronunciations. Users can see the chengyu of the day or browse our library of chengyu to expand their vocabulary of our favourite Cantonese idioms


## Getting Started:
On the development server:

```bash
npm install
node server.js
``` 
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser

## This Site and its API are actively under construction

**Tech used:**
- This project was built using Node.js, Express.js, TailwindCSS, and MongoDB


## Optimizations
- Expanding chengyu API and database
- Add contact form with user submitted chengyu



## Lessons Learned:
- Double and triple check the path of the tailwind config file after the fourth time that it tells me that I linked it wrong.
- It is exceedingly diffiicult to have a site with more than one language on the same page
