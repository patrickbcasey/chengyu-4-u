## Getting Started:
On the development server:

```bash
cd /api
npm install
npm start
cd ../client
npm install
npm start
``` 
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser

The backend is hosted on http://localhost:8000

## This Site and its API are actively under construction

**Tech used:**
- This project was built using Node.js, Express.js, React.js, TailwindCSS & MongoDB


## Optimizations
- Expanding chengyu API and database
- Add contact form with user submitted chengyu



## Lessons Learned:
- Double and triple check the path of the tailwind config file after the fourth time that it tells me that I linked it wrong.
- It is exceedingly difficult to have a site with more than one language on the same page
